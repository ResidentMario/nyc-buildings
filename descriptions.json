  "Trustees of Columbia": "Columbia University is the largest landowner in New York City by number of addresses by a long shot, owning 209 propertiesâ€”twice the number owned properties as the next largest private property-holder, the Duestche Bank National Trust, and almost three times the 72 addresses allotted to the New York Public Library, for comparison. It is also a common candidate in the media for the biggest landowner in New York City, period, and indeed according to the public record the university is first in number, second in size, and third in wealth&mdash;though losing by a sizable margin to NYU on that last count."
