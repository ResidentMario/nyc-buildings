    "## Ownership\n",
    "\n",
    "Who owns the buildings in New York City? This is actually a very difficult question to answer. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, probably owns a formidable number of buildings in the city, but as they tend to be owned in name by individuals or sub-units of the church at large, precisely how much they own is hard to answer. There are also plenty of opaque development groups and investment vehicles around playing the real estate market shell game, making it all the more challenging to follow who owns what and further muddying the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the public record should be able to tell us some very interesting things. To start with, using the `PLUTO` dataset&mdash;a public archival record on everything that the city government knows about every building in New York City&mdash;who is the most enumerate landowner in New York City?\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat obviously the single largest property-holder in New York City is New York City itself, with various agencies of the city government taking all but one of the top 10 and most of the top 50 slots. The one exception is the sixth biggest property-owner, `OWNER / AGENT`&mdash;a mildly questionable instance of indeterminate ownership in the public record. There is also an option for the 33 propreties in the city for whom an owner is apparently simply `UNKNOWN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the public record of public asset ownership is a little haphazard. For instance in additional to dedicated points for each of the individual city agenices there are several different variations on \"the City of New York\" (`CITY OF NEW YORK`, `THE CITY OF NEW YORK`, etc.), and a similar situation exists for federal and state agencies, which are listed either individually or as part of the `UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT` or even `THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK`. So to explore the raw data yourself, go here.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easier for us to examine private entity data. A [Q&A published in *The New York Times* in 1994](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/nyregion/fyi-531286.html) fingers Columbia Univesity, NYU, Trinity Church, and a handful of developers as the biggest in terms of private addresses held. What does the picture look like today? Filtering out public services, here is what the public record has to say about the 20 private owners with the largest number of buildings:"
